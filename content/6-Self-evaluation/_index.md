During my internship at **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Vietnam)** from **September 2025** to **November 2025**, I applied my cloud and backend knowledge to build a real-world **Video Sharing & Livestream Platform** using **.NET 8 Web API**, **Clean Architecture**, and various **AWS Services** such as S3, MediaConvert, DynamoDB, Lambda, CloudFront, and IVS.  
Throughout this project, I improved significantly in areas such as **system design**, **cloud architecture**, **problem-solving**, **API development**, and **team collaboration**.

I was responsible for implementing many core features of the platform, including:

- Video upload → S3 → MediaConvert transcoding  
- Automatic unsafe-content detection using Amazon Rekognition  
- Channel management and subscription system  
- Like, comment (with image upload), and notification workflow  
- Livestream management using Amazon IVS + EventBridge + Lambda  
- API development under Clean Architecture with MediatR, FluentValidation, and ProblemDetails  
- Deploying backend on Azure and frontend on Vercel  

I always strived to complete tasks with quality, followed coding standards, communicated clearly with teammates, and proactively studied AWS best practices to improve the project.

To evaluate my progress objectively, I provide the following assessment:

| No. | Criteria                            | Description                                                                                      | Good | Fair | Average |
