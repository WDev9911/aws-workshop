> Below is my personal sharing about the experience during my internship at AWS Vietnam as part of the First Cloud Journey program. These insights may help the FCJ team further enhance the program for future participants.

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at AWS Vietnam is highly professional yet friendly. Everyone is open to helping whenever I face technical challenges, especially with AWS services that I have never used before. The workspace is clean, comfortable, and equipped with everything needed for learning and development. I felt welcomed and supported from the first day, and the collaborative culture helped me quickly adapt to the team.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor provided strong technical guidance, especially in AWS cloud architecture, serverless workflows, and best practices. Whenever I encountered issues with S3, MediaConvert, or IVS, the mentor gave hints rather than the final answer, helping me develop independence and problem-solving skills.  
The admin team was also very supportive with onboarding, documents, schedules, and ensuring that interns had everything needed to focus on learning.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The project I worked on—building a **Video Sharing & Livestream Platform** using **.NET 8**, **AWS Serverless**, **DynamoDB**, and **event-driven architecture**—was directly related to my major in software engineering. It allowed me to apply what I learned at university while exploring real-world cloud technologies not covered in class. This significantly strengthened both my theoretical and practical understanding.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
This internship offered tremendous learning opportunities. I gained hands-on experience with many AWS services (S3, Lambda, MediaConvert, Rekognition, IVS, DynamoDB), Clean Architecture, and API development. I also improved my skills in debugging, documentation, code standards, and cloud design.  
Through mentorship and workshops, I learned about scalability, security, cost-optimization, and modern development workflows—valuable skills that I will carry into future projects.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The culture at AWS Vietnam is positive, supportive, and growth-oriented. Everyone values respect, collaboration, and ownership. Even though I was an intern, I felt like a true member of the team. When someone faced a technical blocker, others were always willing to step in and help. This created a motivating and welcoming learning environment.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The internship offered flexible working hours, an allowance, and access to AWS learning resources. I also appreciated the weekly sharing sessions, internal learning materials, and guidance related to AWS certifications. These benefits created a balanced learning environment that supported both productivity and personal development.

### Additional Questions

**• What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**  
I was most satisfied with the opportunity to build a real-world cloud project from scratch using AWS services. Seeing the video platform and livestream features working end-to-end was an extremely rewarding experience. I also enjoyed how supportive and friendly the mentors and team members were.

**• What should the company improve for future interns?**  
It would be helpful to have more team-bonding activities or small group sharing sessions among interns so we can learn from one another’s progress and experiences.

**• Would you recommend this internship to a friend? Why or why not?**  
Yes, definitely. The program provides hands-on cloud experience, real AWS mentorship, and a project that is directly applicable to industry. It’s an excellent opportunity for anyone who wants to strengthen both backend and cloud skills.
